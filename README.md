### Steam VR Template ###

Instruction guide [found in the onedrive](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=6283336A7C9CA810!6527&authkey=!AJMU7UC1E0IlaGc&ithint=folder%2czip "pre-authed link")

Disclaimer: The goal of this template is to put together a noob-proof SteamVR pawn to drop in your scene. However, one size for all solutions will not answer to all specific implementations, but it can gives you a head start. The template will be updated regularly with Unreal forum contributors suggestions. 

My eternal thanks to (but not only) @mitchemmc for input maps and controllers mapping and @PenguinTD for amongst many functions , teleportation method #2 and Ultraman.

Thanks to @mordentral for the grabbing fantastic plugin.

All assets are whether homemade, from the public domain or from Epic demos (you can use them freely in UE4 projects).

I remind everyone that any contribution is welcome. The commercial/fun value of VR projects is definitively not on who can use the Vive, who cannot. It's in the whole experience, the universe you are creating, the feeling, the originality and the user experience.

Have fun!

GitHub version at https://github.com/ProteusVR/SteamVR_Template (you need to be logged to Github to open the link) 

To install as a template, just unzip into the appropriate templates directory like C:\Program Files\Unreal Engine[Version]\Templates for launcher version or[ForkLocation]\UE4\Templates for source version. 

Launch a new project, and you'll find it in the blueprint section.

To install as a project file, unzip in your usual projects folder. Then, delete the file SteamVR_x-x/Config/TemplateDefs.ini and you’re ready to go.

Note 1: To enable the template within an existing project:
To migrate pawn in another project:
Migrate Vive_Pawn_Vehicle, Vive_Pawn_Grab_Plugin, or Vive_Pawn_UltraMan in another project
* For Vive_Pawn_Vehicle, migrate the Vehicle Pawn also; for Vive_Pawn_Grab_Plugin be sure that the objects to grab have the blueprints and 3 interfaces and the the grab plugin is in the plugin folder
* For all pawns, select the right pawn in the Steam_GameMode (GM); copy scalability and initial settings in level blueprint; in project settings set Engine/General Settings at USe Fixed Frame Rate 90, Engine/Rendering/Default Postprocessing settings: Uncheck everything (bloom is optional), choose AA method; Engine/Rendering/VR: Check Instanced Stereo. Put a post-process volume in the level and adjust it accordingly. Be sure that the SteamVR Game Mode (SteamVR_GM) and Steam_player_controller have followed if not recreate them.
You should now easily migrate one of these 3 pawns into another project. More example pawns to follow soon.

Note 2: To package your project:
Don’t forget to File/New C++ class, None, Create Class before packaging, if not the plugin won’t follow. Be sure to have a working copy of Visual Studio 2015 enabled.
